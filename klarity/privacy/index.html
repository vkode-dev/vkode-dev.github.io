            Klarity respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your
            personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect,
            use, and safeguard information when you use our app.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> We use AI on our servers only when you
            use the Summarize feature. For this feature, the text you choose to
            submit is sent to our server temporarily for processing. Voice to
            text, transcription, and document scanning are processed on your
            device and are not sent to any server. We do not store any text or
            recordings on our servers. Our AI processing partner may store and
            process summary requests in accordance with their own policies.
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Device information such as operating system and device type is
                collected by Firebase Crashlytics only to detect and report
                crashes. We do not collect personal identifiers or track your
                activity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Document scanning and extracted text are processed locally on
                your device.

            <li>
                Voice recordings and scanned documents are processed locally on

                explicitly send text through an AI feature such as Summarize.
            </li>
            <li>
