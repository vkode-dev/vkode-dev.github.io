            Klarity respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your
            personal information. This privacy policy explains how we collect,
            use, and safeguard information when you use our app.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Your voice recordings and meeting notes
            remain completely on your device. Only the transcribed text from
            "Grammar" or "Summarize" features is sent to the server for further
            processing.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Device information (e.g., operating system, device type) is
                collected only for app functionality and to report crashes via
                Firebase Crashlytics. No personal data or activity is tracked.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Process your transcribed text to provide grammar correction,
                summaries, and translations using GPT, a language model
                developed by OpenAI. Only the text from "Grammar" or "Summarize"
                features is sent to the server. We do not store any data on our
                servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Voice recordings are processed locally on your device and never
                transmitted to any server.
            </li>
            <li>The recordings are deleted after processing.</li>
            <li>
                Improve the app's functionality and performance using anonymized
                crash and error reports via Firebase Crashlytics.
            </li>
        </ul>
